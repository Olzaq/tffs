TFFS README -- last edited 2005-11-30

This is tffs, a read-only driver for the T*PFIELD file system, based on FUSE,
the file system in userspace. With tffs you can mount a hard disk from a
T*PFIELD digital satellite receiver to a directory in your file system tree.
Any program can access the files on your T*PFIELD disk like any other ordinary
file. tffs does not support any write operations. Changing files is 
impossible, as is delete or even renaming files. tffs has so far only been
tested with the T*PFIELD PVR4000. It may or may not work with other models.
Since I have no access to other models, I will not be able to add support for
those. However, if you have some other T*PFIELD device and you can provide
me patch for supporting it, I am willing to include it in tffs.

In order to use tffs, your kernel must include FUSE support. FUSE has been
part of the official Linux kernel since version 2.6.14. For some older
versions, FUSE can be acquired separately to be compiled as a kernel module.

tffs only consists of one program: mount.tffs. It can only be invoked as
super user. For the exact synopsis of the mount.tffs command, consult the
man page. If you like to make the T*PFIELD file system accessible to other
users than root, you must provide the "allow_other" mount option. A typical
call to mount.tffs looks like this:

mount.tffs /dev/sdb /mnt -o allow_other

In the example, the T*PFIELD hard disk corresponds to the device file
/dev/sdb. In my case it is connected to the USB bus (via an IDE-USB-adaptor).
It is mounted to the /mnt directory, and since the allow_other mount option
is specified, users other than root can access the mounted T*PFIELD disk.
Unmount the file system with:

umount /mnt

or by killing the mount.tffs process. For your convenience, you may add a
line to /etc/fstab to ease mounting and to make it possible for non-privileged
users.

If mount.tffs is installed in the /sbin directory, it can be called through the
regular mount program (/bin/mount), by specifying "-t tffs":

mount /dev/sdb /mnt -t tffs -o allow_other

This way, it is easy to configure an automounter for mounting a T*PFIELD disk.
