TFFS INSTALL -- last edited 2005-11-30

In order to compile tffs, you need to have the fuse library installed (as well
as the corresponding header files, which are usually available through a
development package, like libfuse-dev in case of Debian). You also need to
have the SCons build tool installed. Then you can just call "make" or "scons"
to build the mount.tffs binary.

If you don't have SCons installed, you can call your C++ compiler directly:

g++ -Wall -O3 src/main.cpp src/tfdisk.cpp -o bin/mount.tffs -lfuse
